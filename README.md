# Center for Cancer Systems Therapeutics

The Columbia University [Center for Cancer Systems Therapeutics](https://systemsbiology.columbia.edu/cast) (CaST) is a member of the [National Cancer Institute’s Cancer Systems Biology Consortium](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/dcb/research-programs/csbc) (CSBC). As a member of the CSBC, CaST’s overarching aim is to facilitate the development of effective therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. A specific focus of the Center is the development of a network-based, gene interaction framework for the systematic elucidation of inter- and intra-molecular mechanisms contributing to the stability of tumor-related cell states and their pharmacologically actionable molecular dependencies. The purpose of this GitHub site is to disseminate the tools and methodologies developed by CaST investigators, by providing access to relevant code and tutorials.
